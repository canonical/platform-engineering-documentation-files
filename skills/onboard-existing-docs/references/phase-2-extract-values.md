# Phase 2: Extract Project-Specific Values

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (`phase-1-audit`) must be complete. You should already have the `overlapping_files` list.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Run the extraction script

Run the automated extraction script to parse the downstream `docs/conf.py`:

```bash
python3 skills/onboard-existing-docs/assets/extract_conf_values.py docs/conf.py
```

This outputs a JSON object mapping each Copier variable to its extracted value. If the script cannot be run (e.g., the downstream repo doesn't have Python available), proceed with manual extraction in Step 2.

### Step 2: Manual extraction (fallback)

If the script is unavailable, manually read `docs/conf.py` and extract each value. Map to the corresponding Copier question variable:

| In existing `conf.py` | Copier variable | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `project = "..."` | `project` | |
| `author = "..."` | `author` | |
| `copyright = ...` | (not a direct variable) | Template uses `datetime.date.today().year` |
| `ogp_image = "..."` | `ogp_image` | |
| `html_favicon = "..."` | `html_favicon` | May be absent |
| `html_context["product_page"]` | `product_page` | |
| `html_context["product_tag"]` | `product_tag` | May be absent |
| `html_context["discourse"]` | `discourse` | |
| `html_context["mattermost"]` | `mattermost` | |
| `html_context["matrix"]` | `matrix` | |
| `html_context["github_url"]` | `github_url` | |
| `html_context["repo_default_branch"]` | `repo_default_branch` | |
| `html_context["repo_folder"]` | `repo_folder` | |
| `html_context["display_contributors"]` | `display_contributors` | Boolean |

### Step 3: Identify values NOT covered by the template

Note any values in `conf.py` that are NOT covered by the template's Copier variables:
- Custom Sphinx `extensions = [...]` entries beyond what the template provides
- Extra `html_context` keys
- Custom `html_theme_options`
- Any other bespoke configuration

These will be re-applied in Phase 6.

### Step 4: Extract RTD slug (if applicable)

If the downstream repo has a `.readthedocs.yaml`, read it and extract the RTD project slug for the `rtd_slug` Copier variable.

### Step 5: Confirm values with the user

Present the extracted values to the user using the question bank (see [`question-bank.md`](question-bank.md), Section "Confirm Extracted Values"). Ask them to confirm or correct each one before proceeding.

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the user has confirmed all values.

### Hand-off to Phase 3

Carry forward:
- `extracted_values` — dict of Copier variable → confirmed value
- `template_uncovered_values` — list of custom config not covered by the template
- `overlapping_files` — from Phase 1
- `content_files` — from Phase 1
